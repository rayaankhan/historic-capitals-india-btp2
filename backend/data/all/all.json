This happened at a critical juncture in Indian history, when the Indian Rebellion of 1857 led to the dissolution of the British East India Company. The British Raj began when the British government assumed direct rule over India. The exact event happened on March 1, 1858, when the British Raj was effectively founded and the East India Company's control was officially abolished by Queen Victoria's proclamation. Allahabad, which was already a prominent administrative hub for the North-Western Provinces, was given the temporary title of Indian capital as part of this shift. This action served as a symbolic signal for the change in administrative authority and the start of direct India is ruled by the crown. The short time Allahabad lasted as capital, however, emphasised the city's significance in British India and its part in the post-rebellion governmental restructuring. Soon after, Calcutta (now Kolkata) was designated as the new capital, while Allahabad remained an important hub for administration and justice under the British Raj until India's independence in 1947.", "empire": "British Empire.", "dynasty": ""}
