# Historical Capitals of India

## Project Overview - [Link](https://historicalindiancities.netlify.app/)

**Historical Capitals** is an engaging web application designed to explore the history of ancient capitals through an interactive map-based interface. Users can delve into historical data via a dynamic Leaflet map on the left side of the screen, while a scrollable list of capitals is available on the right. The application provides a seamless experience: clicking a map marker opens a popup with the capital's name, and selecting a capital from the list highlights its marker on the map and shows detailed information below. The app also features a chatbot powered by a fine-tuned Gemini-1.5-flash LLM and a feedback form with automated email acknowledgment.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Map:** Explore historical capitals through a Leaflet map with interactive markers.
- **Synchronized List and Map:** Seamless interaction between the map markers and the list of capitals.
- **Detailed Information Display:** Detailed historical information about each capital displayed below the map.
- **Chatbot Interface:** Advanced AI-driven chatbot for user queries, powered by Gemini API and LangChain.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Automated email response system for user feedback.
